            <p>Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He
                briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid conscription.
                He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years
                later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved to California in
                1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the
                web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307
                million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in
                2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>
